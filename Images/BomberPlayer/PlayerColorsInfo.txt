These sprites are essentially "Bomberman
sucked of color".

The colors in these sprites can be replaced
by the game's code to potentially allow
players to customize their character.

Here are the colors in the sprites
themselves[ordered from darkest to
brightest]:

Face:
(0xFF)FFD9B0

Hands:
(0xFF)A0A0A0, (0xFF)B8B8B8, (0xFF)CECECE

Feet & Headball:
(0xFF)101010, (0xFF)3f3f3f , (0xFF)565656,
(0xFF)616161, (0xFF)727272, (0xFF)7e7e7e

Head, Arms, & Legs:
(0xFF)000001, (0xFF)1a1a1a

Torso:
(0xFF)2B2B2B



In Total:
(0xFF)000001, (0xFF)101010, (0xFF)FFD9B0,
(0xFF)1A1A1A, (0xFF)2B2B2B, (0xFF)3f3f3f,
(0xFF)565656, (0xFF)616161, (0xFF)727272,
(0xFF)7E7E7E, (0xFF)A0A0A0, (0xFF)B8B8B8,
(0xFF)CECECE


Here's how colors are decided...

Face: Should be any color that looks like
skin.

Torso: This is its own color.

Head, Arms, & Legs: These share each
other's colors. The darker color is
determined by the brighter color(input)
- 35 reds, 35 greens, and 35 blues. The
code will prevent color overflow and
also limit color input to allow the
sprite to maintain its expected qualities.

Hands: These are decided in a similar
manner to Head, Arms, & Legs. Just with
more colors to it.

Color 1 = input;
Color 2 = Color 1 - 28 Reds, Greens, and Blues;
Color 3 = Color 2 - 30 Reds, Greens, and Blues;

Feet & Headball, and Hands: These are
decided in the same manner as Hands.

Color 1 = input;
Color 2 = Color 1 - 28 Reds, Greens, and Blues;
Color 3 = Color 2 - 30 Reds, Greens, and Blues;
Color 4 = Color 3 - 42 Reds, Greens, and Blues;
Color 5 = Color 4 - 28 Reds, Greens, and Blues;
Color 6 = Color 5 - 28 Reds, Greens, and Blues;
(Ensured to not have color overflow)


What the input should be:

The input should be an Integer array with
Hexadecimal color values in this order:

int[] colors = new int[];
[Face, Torso, Brightest Head Color, Brightest Hand Color, Brightest Headball Color]

ex(White Bomber):[0xFFeec395, 0xFF3f3584, 0xFFffffff, 0xFFeb86b5, 0xFFeb86b5]
