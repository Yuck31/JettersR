Distance between floors: 16 pixels(from under bottom pixel of 
tile, if "wall" is just a resized version of a tile, resize

x = x-((sprite.width/2)*scale)


Good Level Design:
-is Fun to Navigate.
-does not rely on words (to tell a story).
-tells you what to do, but not how to do it.
-constantly teaches.
-is Suprising.
-Empowers the Player.
-is Easy, Medium, AND Hard. (Dynamic difficulty)
-is Efficient.
-creates Emotion.
-is Driven by (in-game) Mechanics.

Good Solo Dev Tips:
-Recieve frequent feedback (concepts, design choices, etc.)
-Create playable demos to the public (for feedback)
-Create a method of Source Control
-Follow Coding Standards (make code efficient, extensible, formatted, diagramed, and commented)
-Don't make own custom en-... HEY! I'm making my own engine just fine!
-Make the games art LOOK like a retail release when the time comes (in other words, do your art homework)
-Create a proper test plan
-DEDICATE, DEDICATE, DEDICATE to the creation of a game. FINISH IT!
